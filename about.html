## About

I am an Android Developer currently seeking employment. Experienced with Android Studio, Java, XML, REST APIs and Git. Curiosity keeps me reading about the latest trends in Android development which usually results in a lot of code experimentation. I learn the best through trial and error and have picked up libraries like Retrofit, Firebase, and Realm this way.

Classically trained as a mechanical engineer in high paced manufacturing facilities; I thrive on working to meet deadlines and gain immense satisfaction delivering a great product.

I am enthusiastic to contribute to a new era of technical competition and growth. Feel free to contact me and learn more about myself and my skills.
