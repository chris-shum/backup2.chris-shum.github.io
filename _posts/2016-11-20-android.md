My experience in Android revolves around my Immersive at General Assembly and my Nanodegree from Udacity (currently in progress of obtaining).

I've been the teaching assistant for the 2nd General Assembly cohort.  They say one who really understands can teach something something.

I've been learning stuff on my own.  My libraries and such.  Realm, Firebase, retrofit, blah blah.

List to add on, RXJava and Dagger.

Continuously learning.
