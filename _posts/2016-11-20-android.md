My Android journey began with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHagBCh0p3g" target="\_blank">General Assembly's Android Development Immersive</a>.  There I learned about Java, XML, Android Studio, Git, REST APIs, Google Material Design and much more.  My performance during the course was recognized and I was offered a position as the next immersive's teaching assistant.  Through teaching, I increased my understanding of Android basics while I simultaneously continued to grow my skill set.  I taught myself to use a number of libraries such as Firebase, Retrofit, Butterknife, and Realm.  I also enrolled in <a href="https://profiles.udacity.com/u/christophershum" target="\_blank">Udacity's Android Development Nanondegree program</a> to continue my Android experience growth as well as supplement my General Assembly Android Development Immersive certificate.

I am continuously learning and currently have my eyes set on RXJava and Dagger.  Feel free to explore my <a href="https://github.com/chris-shum" target="\_blank">Github</a> and checkout my <a href = "https://github.com/chris-shum/chris-shum.github.io/raw/master/resumes/Chris_Shum_Developer_Resume.pdf">resume</a>.
