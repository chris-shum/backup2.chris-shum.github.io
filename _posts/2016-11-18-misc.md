Beyond, my typical work, I'm associated with a number of organizations in which I garner my skills to their benefit.  These include of, but are not limited to Event coordinator, performer, dancer, instructor, photographer, logistics, slow motion booth operator, photo booth operator, tour guide, blah blah, etc.

For more details on the organizations and events I have worked for, please see <a href = "https://github.com/chris-shum/chris-shum.github.io/raw/master/resumes/Chris_Shum_BAResume.pdf">resume</a>.
