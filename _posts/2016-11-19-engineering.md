I am classically trained as a mechanical engineer, having several years of work experience in high paced manufacturing facilities.  I received my bachelor's in physics from <a href = "http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/">Rutgers University</a> while simultaneously working as a lead technician at <a href="http://us.trumpf.com">Trumpf Photonics</a>.  In order to advance myself, I obtained my master's in mechanical engineering from <a href="http://www2.mmu.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught/2016/13396/">Manchester Metropolitan University</a>.  I spent a year working as an electro-mechanical engineer at <a href="http://www.intenseco.com">Intense</a> before beginning my pursuit into the tech industry.

My educational and professional experience prove excellent procedural problem solving skills, adaptation to new technologies, and leadership abilities.  I am experienced in lean manufacturing methodologies that are very similar to software development methodologies like Agile. Also, collaborating with vendors
and customers, adapting my team to sudden changes, and improving processes to deliver the
best products were very typical day to day responsibilities. These are great assets that can transfer over to development culture where developers are expected to spend time obsessively testing features that are functional and engaging, have a strong sense of usability and design, and propose different technologies to improve old things or create new ones with a team of designers and engineers.
